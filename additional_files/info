additional files to copy.

`git cms-merge-topic` adds all packages that include changed files and thus a lot of packages when changing the files added here.

Technically, should be added to CMSSW repo (11_1_2_patch3_dnt_pv3d branch in my repo) but it takes so long that it isn't acceptable.

Ugly workaround: add files to DNT repo and copy them to $CMSSW_BASE/src/<path that is mentioned>. Needs to be checked explicitly when upgrading CMSSW release.

CAUTION: when not running `git cms-checkdeps`, the build will not be consistent and some variables are wrong! Check /afs/cern.ch/user/m/mneukum/public/phase2_btagging/feb2021/not_consistent_plots/*.pdf for comparison plots of all input variables
